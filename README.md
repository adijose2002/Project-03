# The-Phylogenetic-Tree-of-Life Project
In this project I will work with (a fragment) of the phylogenetic Tree of Life, which will be presented in the form of a Python dictionary. Each entry in the dictionary will consist of a string key giving the name of a taxon, and a string value giving the name of the immediate parent of that taxon. I will write a series of functions that can give back information about the tree.
